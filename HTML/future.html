          My disposition for the unforeseeable future is a promise inscribed in the ocean, everything that I have prepared for myself will be lost in oblivion. Even though my plans for my perpetual journey are well-thought, the waves of life will surely find a way to make my journey a long and unforgettable one. During the past few years of my journey with the roaring currents of life - if there is anything that I am regretful of, it is letting my journey be encumbered by unnecessary sentiments. For my future expeditions in my life, I yearn for one thing only - to appreciate the teachings the waves that rock the vessel that I am currently handling, never letting it fetter my eternal voyage into stagnation.

            Not a thing has improved since I composed my latest disposition for my future. Although equipped for the hurdles that I had to face, I nevertheless failed to push my vessel towards the shore of victory. Following my failure of an initial venture into the treacherous challenges of life, many may assume that I would falter, but I will not. The tides of fate will only get crueler, but I am stronger. During my maiden voyage, I realized that I am as resilient as bamboo in the middle of a cyclone, bending to the tormenting winds but never did it break. Just like the bamboo I witnessed, I will never succumb to the predicaments that I have, as I remain on this path to prosperity and success.
